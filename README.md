# odin-recipes

This first TOP project requires me to build a basic recipe website using HTML. The website will intially consist of an index page and three recipe pages, which will all link to one and other.

Upon completion of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to read and write basic HTML, utilising tags such as h1, p, ul, ol and li.
