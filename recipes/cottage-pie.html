            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>

            <li>a small bowl of garden peas</li>

            <li>1 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
            <li>400ml beef stock</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>a few thyme sprigs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the mash</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>750g potatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>10g butter</li>
            <li>100g strong cheddar, grated</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and fry 500g beef mince until browned, then set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Put the other 1 tbsp of olive oil into the pan, add 1 finely chopped onion and 2 chopped carrots, and cook on a gentle heat until soft, about 15 mins.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add 1 finely chopped garlic clove, 1 tbsp plain flour and 1 tbsp tomato purée, increase the heat and cook for a few mins, then return the beef to the pan.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Adding 400ml of beef stock, 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, a few thyme sprigs and the small bowl of garden peas.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 45 mins. By this time the gravy should be thick and coating the meat. Check after about 30 mins, if a lot of liquid remains, increase the heat slightly to reduce the gravy a little. Season well, then discard the thyme stalks.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the mash. In a large saucepan, cover the 750g potatoes which you've peeled and chopped, in salted cold water, bring to the boil and simmer until tender.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Drain well, then allow to steam-dry for a few mins. Mash well with the 10g butter, and three-quarters of the 100g strong cheddar cheese, then season with some salt and pepper.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Spoon the meat into an ovenproof dish. Pipe or spoon on the mash to cover. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and cook for 25-30 mins, or until the topping is golden.</li>
